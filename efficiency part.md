[AtopologyLOAD.m](https://github.com/hakansrc/mlv_inv/blob/master/topologies%20to%20be%20evaluated/losspart/frequency%20variation/A/AtopologyLOAD.m) is the main code that calls for the other functions. The input of this m file is switching waveforms.

[IGBT_cond.m](https://github.com/hakansrc/mlv_inv/blob/master/topologies%20to%20be%20evaluated/losspart/frequency%20variation/A/IGBT_cond.m) function is used to construct the V-I relation of the used semiconductor.

[IGBT_sw.m](https://github.com/hakansrc/mlv_inv/blob/master/topologies%20to%20be%20evaluated/losspart/frequency%20variation/A/IGBT_sw.m) function is used for the construction of the switching energy characteristic of the IGBT.

[diode_cond.m](https://github.com/hakansrc/mlv_inv/blob/master/topologies%20to%20be%20evaluated/losspart/frequency%20variation/A/diode_cond.m) function is for the construction of the V-I relation of the used diode.

[diode_sw.m](https://github.com/hakansrc/mlv_inv/blob/master/topologies%20to%20be%20evaluated/losspart/frequency%20variation/A/diode_sw.m) function is for the switching energy characteristic of the diode.
